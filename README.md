# complexpaths

This repository contains: 
-	Raw edgelists of Addhealth topologies (82 adolescent friend networks) 
-	The largest connected component extracted from each Addhealth topology 
-	An R script that calculates complex path length and complex centrality for all nodes in a given graph g (this includes methods for parallelization). 
-	An R script that replicates all of the figures from the manuscript and supplementary material using the raw simulation data generated for this experiment (data provided below) 

Here is a link to all of the raw data used to generate the main and supplementary figures for this study: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M9sO51Viv9h6e-p83Q6FThOiYZZpdUhJ/view?usp=sharing

The topologies and household-level statistics for the Banerjee et al. (2013) analysis were downloaded from the following data repository (https://osf.io/qu57w/), which originally used this data as “Study 2” for the following article: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0245476
